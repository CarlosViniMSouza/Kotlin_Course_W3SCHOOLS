          Kotlin divides the operators into the following groups:

            째 Arithmetic operators --> This is very easy; its generic for all PLs
            째 Assignment operators
            째 Comparison operators --> This is very easy; its generic for all PLs
            째 Logical operators

        # Kotlin Assignment Operators #

            A list of all assignment operators:

            Operator	Example	    Same As
                =	    x = 10	    x = 10
                +=	    x += 30	    x = x + 30
                -=	    x -= 30	    x = x - 30
                *=	    x *= 30	    x = x * 30
                /=	    x /= 30	    x = x / 30
                %=	    x %= 30	    x = x % 30

        # Kotlin Logical Operators #

            Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

            Operator	Name	   Description	                                            Example
              && 	Logical and	   Returns true if both statements are true	            x < 5 &&  x < 10
              || 	Logical or	   Returns true if one of the statements is true	    x < 5 || x < 4
              !	    Logical not	   Reverse the result                                       x ! y
